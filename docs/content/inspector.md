The **inspector** allows you to view and edit the contents of an [[app]]. To open the inspector, press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (`Cmd+Shift+I` on macOS). You can also open the inspector by pressing the `Inspect` button in the [[context menu#scene context menu]].

Inside of the inspector, there is a [[tree]] of [[widget]]s and a display of the properties of the currently selected widget. You can select an element using the tree or the `Select element` [[button]], which allows you to select an element in the inspector by clicking on it in the app.

You can edit most widget properties in the inspector, including the [[style]]s of a widget once you turn `Override style` on. The [[tooltip]]s of the various properties contain useful information, and the `Geom` is critical for debugging [[layout]] issues.

The `Debug` section of the [[settings]] is also useful for debugging any low-level issues.
