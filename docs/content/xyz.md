**XYZ** is a [[widget]] for interactive 3D viewing and editing. 3D support is currently not present on web, and the API is subject to change. More documentation will be written for xyz once the API is cleaned up. For now, you can see the API documentation for [[doc:xyz]], and the [xyz example](https://github.com/cogentcore/core/tree/main/examples/xyz).

Here is a screenshot of the xyz example:
