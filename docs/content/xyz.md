**XYZ** is a [[widget]] for interactive 3D viewing and editing. 3D support is currently present on all platforms (with the exception of web browsers that do not support [WebGPU](https://caniuse.com/webgpu)), but the API is subject to change. More documentation will be written for xyz once the API is cleaned up. For now, you can see the API documentation for [[doc:xyz]], and the [xyz example](https://github.com/cogentcore/core/tree/main/examples/xyz).

Here is a screenshot of the xyz example:
