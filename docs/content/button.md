A **button** is a [[widget]] that a user can click on to trigger an action. See [[func button]] for a button [[bind|bound]] to a function.

## Properties

You can make a button with [[text]]:

```Go
core.NewButton(b).SetText("Download")
```

You can make a button with an [[icon]]:

```Go
core.NewButton(b).SetIcon(icons.Download)
```

You can make a button with both text and an icon:

```Go
core.NewButton(b).SetText("Download").SetIcon(icons.Download)
```

You can add a popup [[menu]] to a button:

```Go
core.NewButton(b).SetText("Share").SetIcon(icons.Share).SetMenu(func(m *core.Scene) {
    core.NewButton(m).SetText("Copy link")
    core.NewButton(m).SetText("Send message")
})
```

## Events

You can detect when a button is [[events#click]]ed:

```Go
core.NewButton(b).SetText("Send").SetIcon(icons.Send).OnClick(func(e events.Event) {
    core.MessageSnackbar(b, "Message sent")
})
```

You can make a button trigger on a certain [[events#key|keyboard shortcut]] (`Command` is automatically converted to `Control` on non-macOS platforms):

```Go
core.NewButton(b).SetText("Save").SetShortcut("Command+S").OnClick(func(e events.Event) {
    core.MessageSnackbar(b, "File saved")
})
```

You can make a button trigger on a certain semantic [[events#key function]], which have default bindings that the user can customize in their [[settings]]:

```Go
core.NewButton(b).SetText("Open").SetKey(keymap.Open).OnClick(func(e events.Event) {
    core.MessageSnackbar(b, "File opened")
})
```

## Types

Cogent Core provides several different types of buttons for different use cases.

Filled buttons are used for prominent actions, and they are the default type of button:

```Go
core.NewButton(b).SetType(core.ButtonFilled).SetText("Filled")
```

Tonal buttons are similar to filled buttons but have less emphasis, making them appropriate for less important and more numerous actions:

```Go
core.NewButton(b).SetType(core.ButtonTonal).SetText("Tonal")
```

Elevated buttons have a [[styles#shadow]] and a light [[styles#background]], and they are typically used when a button needs to stand out from its surroundings, like when it is above an [[image]]:

```Go
core.NewButton(b).SetType(core.ButtonElevated).SetText("Elevated")
```

Outlined buttons have a [[styles#border]] and no background, and they are typically used for secondary actions like canceling or going back:

```Go
core.NewButton(b).SetType(core.ButtonOutlined).SetText("Outlined")
```

Text buttons have no border and no background, and they should only be used for low-importance actions:

```Go
core.NewButton(b).SetType(core.ButtonText).SetText("Text")
```

Action and menu buttons are the most minimal buttons, and they are typically only used in the context of other widgets, like [[toolbar]]s and [[menu]]s (buttons in toolbars automatically become action buttons, and buttons in menus automatically become menu buttons):

```Go
core.NewButton(b).SetType(core.ButtonAction).SetText("Action")
```
