All Cogent Core apps can be **built** using normal `go` commands (`go build`, `go run`, `go install`, etc). This means that things such as tests, debuggers, and race detectors work as usual.

However, the Cogent Core command line tool `core` provides a build process optimized for cross-platform Cogent Core development. This tool automatically sets appropriate linker flags to reduce binary sizes, optimizes binaries for running as standalone GUI apps, and provides support for building for [[mobile]] and [[web]] platforms.

The `core` command line tool provides four main build commands, as documented below. In general, you should use `core run` during development.

1. `core build` builds a standalone binary executable for the app

2. `core run` builds a standalone binary executable for the app and then runs it on the target device

3. `core pack` packages the app into a self-contained package and builds an installer for it

4. `core install` installs the app on the target system

You can build for mobile and web platforms by adding the platform name after the command. For example, you can run `core run android` to build and run an app on an Android device, `core build ios` to build an app for an iOS device, and `core run web` to serve an app on the web.

Note: `core run web` is mainly used for serving an app locally; to deploy an app on the web, you can use `core build web` and a static site host (here is an [example](https://github.com/cogentcore/cogentcore.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/core.yml) using GitHub Pages).

If there is an `icon.svg` file in the current directory, it will be used as the app icon on all platforms.

For development on Android, you need to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), and for development on iOS, you need to install [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). For Android development, if you run into any errors with the Android NDK, you should ensure that it is [installed](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk#default-version). You may also need to add the Android tools [to your PATH](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29083170).

## Details

You can build for Android on all desktop platforms, and for iOS on macOS only. Cross-compiling between desktop platforms is planned but not yet supported.

The file(s) produced by `core build` are `.exe` on Windows, `.app` on iOS, `.apk` on Android, `.wasm` and associated `.html` and `.js` files on Web, and no extension on macOS and Linux. The file(s) are placed in the current directory for desktop platforms, and `bin/{platform}` for other platforms (eg: `bin/android`).

For desktop platforms, `core run` just runs the executable directly. For mobile platforms, it installs the executable package on the target device (which can be a simulator or a real connected device) using `core install` and then starts it. For web, it serves the files in `bin/web` at http://localhost:8080.

On mobile and web platforms, `core pack` is the same as `core build`, as that already makes a package on those platforms. On macOS, it makes a `.app` bundle file and a `.dmg` disk image installer file. On Windows, it makes a `.exe` installer file. On Linux, it makes a `.deb` package file.

For macOS, `core install` means running `core pack` and then copying the resulting `.app` file to `Applications`. It is not yet implemented on Linux and Windows. For mobile platforms, it installs the executable package on the target device, which can be a simulator or a real connected device. For web, it is not applicable.
