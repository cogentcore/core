// Cogent Core event structure was originally derived from go.wde and golang/x/mobile/event
// but has diverged significantly from there.  Also informed by JavaScript event type.
//
// Cogent Core requires event type enum for widgets to request what events to
// receive, and we add an overall interface with base support for time and
// marking events as processed, which is critical for simplifying logic and
// preventing unintended multiple effects
//
// Goosi deals exclusively in raw "dot" pixel integer coordinates (as in
// go.wde) -- abstraction to different DPI etc takes place higher up in the
// system

type Event interface {
	fmt.Stringer

	// Type returns the type of event associated with given event
	Type() Types

	// AsBase returns this event as a Base event type,
	// which is used for most Event types.
	AsBase() *Base

	// IsUnique returns true if this event must always be sent,
	// even if the last event sent is of the same type.
	// This is true for Key, MouseButton,
	// Otherwise, events of the same type are compressed
	// such that if the last one written to the queue is of
	// the same type, it is replaced instead of adding a new one.
	IsUnique() bool

	// NeedsFocus this event goes to current focus widget
	NeedsFocus() bool

	// HasPos returns true if the event has a window position where it takes place
	HasPos() bool

	// WindowPos returns the original window-based position in raw display dots
	// (pixels) where event took place.
	WindowPos() image.Point

	// SetLocalOff sets the offset subtracted from window-based positions
	// to compute Local versions of positions, which are updated.
	SetLocalOff(off image.Point)

	// LocalOff returns the offset subtracted from window-based positions
	// to compute Local versions of positions.
	LocalOff() image.Point

	// Pos returns the local position, which is adjusted from the WindowPos
	// via SubLocalOffset based on a local top-left coordinate for a region
	// within the window.
	Pos() image.Point

	// WindowStartPos returns the starting (MouseDown) window-based position.
	WindowStartPos() image.Point

	// StartPos returns the starting (MouseDown) local position
	StartPos() image.Point

	// StartDelta returns Pos - Start
	StartDelta() image.Point

	// WindowPrevPos returns the previous (MouseMove/Drag) window-based position.
	WindowPrevPos() image.Point

	// PrevPos returns the previous (MouseMove/Drag) local position
	PrevPos() image.Point

	// PrevDelta returns Pos - Prev
	PrevDelta() image.Point

	// Time returns the time at which the event was generated, in UnixNano nanosecond units
	Time() time.Time

	// StartTime returns time of StartPos (MouseDown),
	// or other starting time of relevance to the event.
	StartTime() time.Time

	SinceStart() time.Duration

	// PrevTime returns time of PrevPos (MouseMove),
	// or other earlier time of relevance to the event.
	PrevTime() time.Time

	// SincePrev returns Time().Sub(PrevTime()) -- duration since Prev
	SincePrev() time.Duration

	// IsHandled returns whether this event has already been processed
	// Event handling checks this and terminates processing if
	// SetHandled has been called.
	IsHandled() bool

	// SetHandled marks the event as having been processed,
	// so no further processing occurs.  This can accomplish
	// the same effect as PreventDefault function in JavaScript.
	SetHandled()

	// ClearHandled marks the event as no longer having been processed,
	// meaning that it will be processed by future event handlers.
	// This reverses the effects of [Event.SetHandled].
	ClearHandled()

	// Init sets the time to now, and any other initialization.
	// Done just prior to event Send.
	Init()

	// Clone returns a duplicate of this event with the basic event parameters
	// copied (specialized Event types have their own CloneX methods)
	// and the Handled flag is reset.  This is suitable for repurposing.
	Clone() Event

	// NewFromClone returns a duplicate of this event with the basic event parameters
	// copied, and type set to given type.  The resulting type is ready for sending.
	NewFromClone(typ Types) Event

	// SetTime sets the event time to Now
	SetTime()

	// IsSame returns true if the current event is the same as other.
	// Checks Type and, where relevant, Action.
	IsSame(oth Event) bool

	// MouseButton is the mouse button being pressed or released, for relevant events.
	MouseButton() Buttons

	// SelectMode returns the selection mode based on given modifiers on event

	// HasAnyModifier testes whether any of the given modifiers were set
	HasAnyModifier(mods ...enums.BitFlag) bool

	// Rune is the meaning of the key event as determined by the
	// operating system. The mapping is determined by system-dependent
	// current layout, modifiers, lock-states, etc.
	KeyRune() rune

	// Code is the identity of the physical key relative to a notional
	// "standard" keyboard, independent of current layout, modifiers,
	// lock-states, etc
	//
	// For standard key codes, its value matches USB HID key codes.
	// Compare its value to uint32-typed constants in this package, such
	// as CodeLeftShift and CodeEscape.
	//
	// Pressing the regular '2' key and number-pad '2' key (with Num-Lock)
	// generate different Codes (but the same Rune).
	KeyCode() key.Codes

	// keyboard function maps, etc. Printable runes are sent directly, and
	// non-printable ones are converted to their corresponding code names without
	// the "Code" prefix.
	KeyChord() key.Chord
