See Click for a synthetic event representing a MouseDown followed by MouseUp on the same element with Left (primary) mouse button. Often that is the most useful.`, 2: `MouseUp happens when a mouse button is released. See MouseButton() for which.`, 3: `MouseMove is always sent when the mouse is moving but no button is down, even if there might be other higher-level events too. These can be numerous and thus it is typically more efficient to listen to other events derived from this. Not unique, and Prev position is updated during compression.`, 4: `MouseDrag is always sent when the mouse is moving and there is a button down, even if there might be other higher-level events too. The start pos indicates where (and when) button first was pressed. Not unique and Prev position is updated during compression.`, 5: `Click represents a MouseDown followed by MouseUp in sequence on the same element, with the Left (primary) button. This is the typical event for most basic user interaction.`, 6: `DoubleClick represents two Click events in a row in rapid succession.`, 7: `TripleClick represents three Click events in a row in rapid succession.`, 8: `ContextMenu represents a MouseDown/Up event with the Right mouse button (which is also activated by Control key + Left Click).`, 9: `LongPressStart is when the mouse has been relatively stable after MouseDown on an element for a minimum duration (500 msec default).`, 10: `LongPressEnd is sent after LongPressStart when the mouse has gone up, moved sufficiently, left the current element, or another input event has happened.`, 11: `MouseEnter is when the mouse enters the bounding box of a new element. It is used for setting the Hover state, and can trigger cursor changes. See DragEnter for alternative case during Drag events.`, 12: `MouseLeave is when the mouse leaves the bounding box of an element, that previously had a MouseEnter event. Given that elements can have overlapping bounding boxes (e.g., child elements within a container), it is not the case that a MouseEnter on a child triggers a MouseLeave on surrounding containers. See DragLeave for alternative case during Drag events.`, 13: `LongHoverStart is when the mouse has been relatively stable after MouseEnter on an element for a minimum duration (500 msec default). This triggers the LongHover state typically used for Tooltips.`, 14: `LongHoverEnd is after LongHoverStart when the mouse has moved sufficiently, left the current element, or another input event has happened, thereby terminating the LongHover state.`, 15: `DragStart is at the start of a drag-n-drop event sequence, when a Draggable element is Active and a sufficient distance of MouseDrag events has occurred to engage the DragStart event.`, 16: `DragMove is for a MouseDrag event during the drag-n-drop sequence. Usually don&#39;t need to listen to this one. MouseDrag is also sent.`, 17: `DragEnter is like MouseEnter but after a DragStart during a drag-n-drop sequence. MouseEnter is not sent in this case.`, 18: `DragLeave is like MouseLeave but after a DragStart during a drag-n-drop sequence. MouseLeave is not sent in this case.`, 19: `Drop is sent when an item being Dragged is dropped on top of a target element. The event struct should be DragDrop.`, 20: `DropDeleteSource is sent to the source Drag element if the Drag-n-Drop event is a Move type, which requires deleting the source element. The event struct should be DragDrop.`, 21: `SlideStart is for a Slideable element when Active and a sufficient distance of MouseDrag events has occurred to engage the SlideStart event. Sets the Sliding state.`, 22: `SlideMove is for a Slideable element after SlideStart is being dragged via MouseDrag events.`, 23: `SlideStop is when the mouse button is released on a Slideable element being dragged via MouseDrag events. This typically also accompanied by a Changed event for the new slider value.`, 24: `Scroll is for scroll wheel or other scrolling events (gestures). These are not unique and Delta is updated during compression. The [MouseScroll.Delta] on scroll events is always in real pixel/dot units; low-level sources may be in lines or pages, but we normalize everything to real pixels/dots.`, 25: `KeyDown is when a key is pressed down. This provides fine-grained data about each key as it happens. KeyChord is recommended for a more complete Key event.`, 26: `KeyUp is when a key is released. This provides fine-grained data about each key as it happens. KeyChord is recommended for a more complete Key event.`, 27: `KeyChord is only generated when a non-modifier key is released, and it also contains a string representation of the full chord, suitable for translation into keyboard commands, emacs-style etc. It can be somewhat delayed relative to the KeyUp.`, 28: `TouchStart is when a touch event starts, for the low-level touch event processing. TouchStart also activates MouseDown, Scroll, Magnify, or Rotate events depending on gesture recognition.`, 29: `TouchEnd is when a touch event ends, for the low-level touch event processing. TouchEnd also activates MouseUp events depending on gesture recognition.`, 30: `TouchMove is when a touch event moves, for the low-level touch event processing. TouchMove also activates MouseMove, Scroll, Magnify, or Rotate events depending on gesture recognition.`, 31: `Magnify is a touch-based magnify event (e.g., pinch)`, 32: `Rotate is a touch-based rotate event.`, 33: `Select is sent for any direction of selection change on (or within if relevant) a Selectable element. Typically need to query the element(s) to determine current selection state.`, 34: `Focus is sent when a Focusable element receives keyboard focus (ie: by tabbing).`, 35: `FocusLost is sent when a Focusable element loses keyboard focus.`, 36: `Attend is sent when a Pressable element is programmatically set as Attended through an event. Typically the Attended state is engaged by clicking. Attention is like Focus, in that there is only 1 element at a time in the Attended state, but it does not direct keyboard input. The primary effect of attention is on scrolling events via [abilities.ScrollableUnattended].`, 37: `AttendLost is sent when a different Pressable element is Attended.`, 38: `Change is when a value represented by the element has been changed by the user and committed (for example, someone has typed text in a textfield and then pressed enter). This is *not* triggered when the value has not been committed; see [Input] for that. This is for Editable, Checkable, and Slidable items.`, 39: `Input is when a value represented by the element has changed, but has not necessarily been committed (for example, this triggers each time someone presses a key in a text field). This *is* triggered when the value has not been committed; see [Change] for a version that only occurs when the value is committed. This is for Editable, Checkable, and Slidable items.`, 40: `Show is sent to widgets when their Scene is first shown to the user in its final form, and whenever a major content managing widget (e.g., [core.Tabs], [core.Pages]) shows a new tab/page/element (via [core.WidgetBase.Shown] or DeferShown). This can be used for updates that depend on other elements, or relatively expensive updates that should be only done when actually needed &#34;at show time&#34;.`, 41: `Close is sent to widgets when their Scene is being closed. This is an opportunity to save unsaved edits, for example. This is guaranteed to only happen once per widget per Scene.`, 42: `Window reports on changes in the window position, visibility (iconify), focus changes, screen update, and closing. These are only sent once per event (Unique).`, 43: `WindowResize happens when the window has been resized, which can happen continuously during a user resizing episode. These are not Unique events, and are compressed to minimize lag.`, 44: `WindowPaint is sent continuously at FPS frequency (60 frames per second by default) to drive updating check on the window. It is not unique, will be compressed to keep pace with updating.`, 45: `OS is an operating system generated event (app level typically)`, 46: `OSOpenFiles is an event telling app to open given files`, 47: `Custom is a user-defined event with a data any field`}
