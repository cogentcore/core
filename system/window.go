// Window is a double-buffered OS-specific hardware window.

// It provides basic GPU support functions, and is currently implemented

// The Window maintains its own [Drawer] drawing system for rendering
// bitmap images and filled regions onto the window surface.
//
// The base full-window image should be drawn with a Scale call first,
// followed by any overlay images such as sprites or direct upload
// images already on the GPU (e.g., from 3D render frames)
