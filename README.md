**NOTE:** GoKi is currently undergoing a period of significant development to make it easier to make useful, fast, stunning, meaningful and beautiful apps and support running apps on mobile. As such, some of the information in this repository and on the [GoKi website](https://GoKi.dev) may be incorrect. Furthermore, there may be breaking changes soon, so starting new apps with this framework is not recommended at this time; if you do, please be ready to adjust to any breaking changes. If you want to accelerate the improvement of GoKi, please contribute by following the [Contribution Guidelines](https://goki.dev/docs/general/contributionguidelines/). Development of Gi is currently happening on this branch. For the latest stable version of Gi, import version 1.3.19 and see the [v1 branch](https://github.com/goki/gi/tree/v1).

GoGi is part of the [GoKi](https://GoKi.dev) Go language (golang) full strength tree structure system (ki = æœ¨ = tree in Japanese)

`package gi` is a scenegraph-based 2D and 3D GUI / graphics interface (Gi) in Go, that functions similar to HTML / CSS / SVG  and Qt.

NOTE: Requires Go version `1.18+` -- now using the new generics.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/goki/gi/wiki) for more docs (increasingly extensive), [Install](https://github.com/goki/gi/wiki/Install) instructions (mostly basic `go build` procedure, but does now depend on `cgo` on all platforms due to `glfw`, so see details for each platform -- for mac you must now install the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com), and [Google Groups goki-gi](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/goki-gi) email list, and the new github [Discussions](https://github.com/goki/gi/discussions) tool.

GoGi uses the [GoKi](https://goki.dev/ki/v2) tree infrastructure to implement a scenegraph-based GUI framework in full native idiomatic Go, with minimal OS-specific backend interfaces based originally on the [Shiny](https://github.com/golang/exp/tree/master/shiny) drivers, now using [go-gl/glfw](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw) and vulkan-based [vgpu](https://goki.dev/vgpu/v2), and supporting MacOS, Linux and Windows.

The overall design integrates existing standards and conventions from widely-used frameworks, including Qt (overall widget design), HTML / CSS (styling), and SVG (rendering).  The core `Layout` object automates most of the complexity associated with GUI construction (including scrolling), so the programmer mainly just needs to add the elements, and set their style properties -- similar to HTML.  The main 2D framework also integrates with a 3D scenegraph, supporting interesting combinations of these frameworks (see `gi3d` package and [examples/gi3d](https://github.com/goki/gi/tree/master/examples/gi3d)).  Currently GoGi is focused on desktop systems but nothing should prevent adaptation to mobile. 

See [Gide](https://github.com/goki/gide) for a complete, complex application written in GoGi (an IDE), and likewise the [Emergent](https://github.com/emer/emergent) neural network simulation environment (the prime motivator for the whole project), along with the various examples in this repository for lots of useful and meaningful demonstrations -- start with the  [Widgets](https://github.com/goki/gi/tree/master/examples/widgets) example which has a bit of a tutorial introduction.

# Main Features

* Has all the standard widgets: `Button`, `Menu`, `Slider`, `TextField`, `Spinner`, `Chooser` etc, with tooltips, hover, focus, copy / paste (full native clipboard support), drag-n-drop -- the full set of standard GUI functionality.  See `gi/examples/demo` for a demo of all the widgets.

* `Layout` auto-organizes and auto-sizes everything to configure interfaces that "just work" across different scales, resolutions, platforms.  Automatically remembers and reinstates window positions and sizes across sessions, and supports standard `Ctrl+` and `Ctrl-` zooming of display scale.

* CSS-based styling allows customization of everything -- native style properties are HTML compatible (with all standard `em`, `px`, `pct` etc units), including HTML "rich text" styling for all text rendering (e.g., in `Label` widget) -- can decorate any text with inline tags (`<strong>`, `<em>` etc), and even include links.  Styling is now separated out into `gist` package, for easier navigation.

* Compiles in seconds, compared to many minutes to hours for comparable alternatives such as Qt and with minimal cgo dependency and vulkan provides fully cross-platform consistent rendering (2D via vdraw, 3D via vphong):  [vgpu](https://goki.dev/vgpu/v2).

* Fully self-contained -- does *not* use OS-specific native widgets -- results in simpler, consistent code across platforms, and is `HiDPI` capable and scalable using standard `Ctrl/Cmd+Plus or Minus` key and in `Preferences`.For example this also allows a complete 2D GUI to be embedded into a 3D scene. 

* `SVG` element (in [svg](https://github.com/goki/svg)) supports SVG rendering -- used for Icons internally and available for advanced graphics displays -- see `gi/examples/svg` for viewer and [grid](https://github.com/goki/grid) gui editor.

* **Value / View** paradigm with `reflect`ion-based `giv.Value` elements that are the GUI equivalent of `reflect.Value` and enable full GUI interaction with all the standard Go types, in the [giv](giv) sub-package.  Basic types like `int` and `float` display in a `Spinner`, and [enums](https://github.com/goki/enums) `const int` types in a `Chooser` dropdown).  Composite data structures have a corresponding `View`, including `StructView` editor of `struct` fields, `MapView` and `SliceView` displays of `map` and `slice` elements (including full editing / adding / deleting of elements), and full-featured `TableView` for a `slice`-of-`struct` and `TreeView` for GoKi trees.
    + `TreeView` enables a built-in GUI editor / inspector for designing gui elements themselves.  Just press `Control+Alt+I` in any window to pull up this editor / inspector.  Scene graphs can be automatically saved / loaded from JSON files, to provide a basic GUI designer framework -- just load and add appropriate connections..
    
* GoGi is a "standard" *retained-mode* (scenegraph-based) GUI, as compared to *immediate-mode* GUIs such as [Gio](https://gioui.org).  As such, GoGi automatically takes care of everything for you, but as a result you sacrifice control over every last detail.  Immediate mode gives you full control, but also the full burden of control -- you have to code every last behavior yourself.  In GoGi, you have extensive control through styling and closure-based "callback" methods, in the same way you would in a standard front-end web application (so it will likely be more familiar to many users), but if you want to do something very different, you will likely need to code a new type of Widget, which can be more difficult as then you need to know more about the overall infrastructure.  Thus, if you are likely to be doing fairly standard things and don't feel the need for absolute control, GoGi will likely be an easier experience.

# Code Overview

* In general, the programming model is similar to the standard web / JavaScript model, with event callback methods providing custom functionality and CSS-based style properties.

* `gi.Scene` represents a collection of `gi.Widget` elements that form the content of the GUI.  There is full CSS-based styling (e.g., the Box model) and easy and performant customization of any styles.  The Material Design 3 standard is used by default.

* `gi.Stage` provides different functional presentation modes of a `Scene`, including `Window`, `Dialog`, `Snackbar`, `Menu` etc.  The main `Window` type lives within a `RenderWin` window that actually manages the rendering, with only one such window on mobile (any number on desktop).  The `gi.StageMgr` stage manager manages stacks of Stage elements, e.g., a stack of `Window` elements that can be navigated through on a mobile app.  There are sub-types of stage managers for popups (Snackbar, Menu, Tooltip, etc) vs. `MainStage` elements (`Window`, `Dialog`, `Sheet`), which each have their own stack of popups.

* Similar to JavaScript, the `goosi/events.Event` provides the backbone of communication of user GUI mouse, keyboard, touch events to Widgets, and different behavior is implemented by handler functions, e.g., `OnClick(func(e events.Event) {...})`.

* The `WidgetBase` type handles all standard events and behavior based on `Style.Abilities` ability flags, setting `Style.State` flags (e.g., Selected, Focused, etc) and sending events signaling these state changes, so that event `Listeners` can perform custom behavior.  See the `HandleWidgetEvents()` method for all the default handlers, which can be customized in specific Widget types.

* `SetValue` kinds of methods are wrapped in `UpdateStart` / `End` from the [ki](https://github.com/goki/ki) framework, and they flag when a Widget needs to be rendered or a full scene layout is required.  The `*Action` version of these methods also sends a `events.Change` signal that alerts listeners to the change.

# Backend

The [goosi](https://github.com/gok/goosi) system provides interface abstractions for hardware-level implementations, using [vgpu](https://goki.dev/vgpu/v2) for Vulkan-based rendering,  [glfw](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw) (version 3.3) for desktop platform-specific details, and mobile code for ios and android adapted from the go-mobile package.

All of the main "front end" code just deals with `image.RGBA` through the [girl](https://goki.dev/girl) rendering library, using `girl.Paint` methods, which was adapted from [fogleman/gg](https://github.com/fogleman/gg), and we use [srwiley/rasterx](https://github.com/srwiley/rasterx) for CPU-based rasterization to the image, which is fast and SVG performant.   The [vgpu/vdraw](https://goki.dev/vgpu/v2/vdraw) package performs optimized GPU texture-based compositing to assemble the final display in a way that minimizes the copying of image data up to the GPU, and supports overlays such as popups and sprites.  Any 3D scene elements are accessed directly within the GPU.

# Detailed Render Logic

There are 4 major steps to making the `Scene` tree of `Widget` elements ready to render:

1. `Config` configures `Parts` and other settings on the `Widget` based on settings reflected in the fields of the Widget.  This is "structural" in terms of sub-widget parts, but not about styling.

2. `ApplyStyle` applies styling functions to the configured `Widget` to determine how it will look when rendered.  Generally it should be called after any `Config` step, and the `ReConfig` method on a widget does just this.

3. `DoLayout` gathers sizes and uses styling info etc to arrange widgets on the screen.  This generally must be done after changes made in `Config` or `ApplyStyle`, which set flags indicating that this is needed at the next render pass.  Critically, DoLayout is where the Styling settings made in ApplyStyle are "cached out" into raw pixel dots, based on the DPI and Size of the window.

4. `Render` itself does the actual drawing of the widgets to the `Scene` `Pixels` image, which is then uploaded to the `RenderWin` window that you actually see.

The window updating happens in a separate step, typically 60 times per second, which checks for flags on the `Scene` indicating if any new rendering or layout updating is needed.  This separate updating pass is designed to eliminate the possibility of collisions between updating and rendering, using atomically set flags to signal what needs to be updated at any point (these flags are not set until _after_ changes have been made, and unchanged nodes are not re-renderd).

## Initial configuration

First, there is code, e.g., in user's `mainrun` function, or other libraries, that calls `NewScene` and `NewButton` etc to construct widgets for a scene.  During this process, various parameters (fields) on the Widgets are set, that then determine e.g., how the Parts of the widget will then be configured.

## Stage.Run()

When the `scene` is put into a `Stage` container and then `Run()`, we call `ConfigScene()` on the Scene to make sure that everything is fully configured according to the settings made during initial construction.

## RenderWindow

Then, when the Scene is actually rendered to a `RenderWin` window that you can actually see, it is continually subject to various levels of updating depending on how much it has changed.

* If the `RenderWin` has a different size or DPI than the Scene was previously presented at, then `ApplyStyleScene` is called to allow `Style` functions to do things differently depending on the rendering context (i.e., "responsive" styling).  Then, a full Layout and render pass is done.

* If anything was subject to `Config` or `ApplyStyle` changes, then a new `DoLayout` pass is done.

* If only State changes were made due to events (e.g., a mouse hovering over a button), then just a `Render` update is done.

The computing of actual style sizes in terms of dots, which happens in `SetUnitContext`, has to happen twice: first in `ApplyStyle` so that the layout `GetSizes` functions have correct info about how much size a label etc takes when rendered, and then after the Layout is done, to reflect what is actually going to be rendered.

## Scrolling, other Spaces

* LayoutScroll: optional pass invoked by scrollbars to move elements relative to their previously-assigned positions.

* SVG nodes skip the Size and Layout passes, and render directly into parent SVG viewport


# v2 Rewrite TODO / Discussion

## TODO

* Get rid of extra UpdateStart / End in Config* calls -- all are wrapped in outer Config so unnec.

* get rid of all the extra Config calls in SetStyle and Render!

* fix all `Set..`, `...Action` state-changing methods to detect whether Config, layout, or just render is needed.  Also add return val so chain-based setting works.

* in general, "SetNeedsFullReRender" -> SetNeedsLayout() or true

* TextField:KeyChord -- need dialog!  should have a better mech for this.

* does StageMgr need ordmap or could just use slices?  do we ever actually lookup by name??

## Window is not a Ki

* contains a stack of Viewports, the first of which is the main window, rest are popups.

## Viewport is not a Ki, is the base struct for each separate tree

* Viewport represents: main window and each popup -> window, tooltip, dialog, etc.

* Viewport has a Frame field which is the base of each tree

* is passed as arg, not stored on obj: all methods take the viewport!
* so much cleaner vs. mutexes, safe finding, etc.

## Init2D -> Config

* ConfigAll called during window Show, but otherwise not called!
* manually call Config on individual elements if properties change.

## Style2D -> SetStyle

* called automatically for any state change

* Widget SetState method is called with bitflag to set: checks if state is not yet set: if so, sets flag, calls SetStyle() wrapped in UpdateStart / End.

## Robust updating logic redo

See [render.go](gi/render.go) for updated version:

* Config calls SetStyle, within an overall Update Start / End block

* ki.UpdateEnd() in Config or SetStyle calls SetRender method, which sets flag in node (all below it will be rendered) and a NeedsRender flag on the Viewport (need the viewport for this -- cache in Config, only use for setting this one flag!).

* Window iterates through Viewports on a timer loop, and checks if any have VpNeedsRender flag set, and not VpIsRendering flag -- calls RenderAll on them, passing viewport down.  *first* step is to clear VpNeedsRender flag so any further updates can register need, and each node's NeedsRender flag is cleared after rendering *starts*.  Better to err on side of extra rendering.

* If Config modifies the tree, then FullRender is needed: GetSize, DoLayout, then Render

* If State changes, Style then Render needs to be called..
