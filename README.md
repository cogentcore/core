A free and open source framework for building powerful, fast, and cogent 2D and 3D GUIs that run on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, and the Web with a single pure Go codebase, allowing you to Code Once, Run Everywhere. See the [Cogent Core Website](https://cogentcore.org/core) for more information, including extensive documentation and interactive running examples. The website itself is a Cogent Core app running on the web using WASM (see [docs](docs)).

> **NOTE:** Cogent Core is currently undergoing a period of significant development to make it easier to make powerful, fast, and cogent apps. As such, some of the information in this repository and on the Cogent Core website may be incorrect. Furthermore, there are ongoing breaking changes, so starting new apps with this framework is not recommended at this time; if you do, please be ready to adjust to any breaking changes. We are planning to make a v1 stable release at the end of March (see the [v1 milestone](https://github.com/cogentcore/core/milestone/1)).
