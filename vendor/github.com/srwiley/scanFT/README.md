# scanFT
scanFT is an antialiaser derived from the [golang freetype](https://github.com/golang/freetype) translation.

scanFT encodes the ScannerFT struct that satisfies the Scanner interface of the [rasterx](https://github.com/srwiley/rasterx) rasterizer package which implements full SVG2.0 path functions, including the newer 'arc' join-mode.
