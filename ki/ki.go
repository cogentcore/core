// The Ki interface provides the core functionality for a Cogent Core tree.
// Each Ki is a node in the tree and can have child nodes, and no cycles
// are allowed (i.e., each node can only appear once in the tree).
// All the usual methods are included for accessing and managing Children,
// and efficiently traversing the tree and calling functions on the nodes.
// In addition, Ki nodes can have Fields that are also Ki nodes that
// are included in all the automatic tree traversal methods -- they are
// effectively named fixed children that are automatically present.
//
// In general, the names of the children of a given node should all be unique.
// The following functions defined in ki package can be used:
// UniqueNameCheck(node) to check for unique names on node if uncertain.
// UniqueNameCheckAll(node) to check entire tree under given node.
// UniquifyNames(node) to add a suffix to name to ensure uniqueness.
// UniquifyNamesAll(node) to to uniquify all names in entire tree.
//
// Use function MoveChild to move a node between trees or within a tree --
// otherwise nodes are typically created and deleted but not moved.
//
// The Ki interface is designed to support virtual method calling in Go
// and is only intended to be implemented once, by the ki.Node type
// (as opposed to interfaces that are used for hiding multiple different
// implementations of a common concept).  Thus, all of the fields in ki.Node
// are exported (have captital names), to be accessed directly in types
// that embed and extend the ki.Node. The Ki interface has the "formal" name
// (e.g., Children) while the Node has the "nickname" (e.g., Kids).  See the
// Naming Conventions on the Cogent Core Wiki for more details.
//
// Each Node stores the Ki interface version of itself, as This() / Ths
// which enables full virtual function calling by calling the method
// on that interface instead of directly on the receiver Node itself.
// This requires proper initialization via Init method of the Ki interface.
//
// Ki nodes also support the following core functionality:
//   - UpdateStart() / UpdateEnd() to wrap around tree updating code, which then
//     automatically triggers update signals at the highest level of the
//     affected tree, resulting in efficient updating logic for arbitrary
//     nested tree modifications.
//   - ConfigChildren system for minimally updating children to fit a given
//     Name & Type template.
//   - Automatic JSON I/O of entire tree including type information.

	// InitName initializes this node to given actual object as a Ki interface
	// and sets its name. The names should be unique among children of a node.
	// This is needed for root nodes -- automatically done for other nodes
	// when they are added to the Ki tree. If the name is unspecified, it
	// defaults to the ID (kebab-case) name of the type.
	// Even though this is a method and gets the method receiver, it needs
	// an "external" version of itself passed as the first arg, from which
	// the proper Ki interface pointer will be obtained.  This is the only
	// way to get virtual functional calling to work within the Go language.
