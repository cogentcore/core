Package vgpu implements a convenient interface to the Vulkan GPU-based
graphics and compute framework, in Go, using the
https://github.com/vulkan-go/vulkan Go bindings.

The GoGi GUI framework runs on top if this, replacing the previous
OpenGL-based framework, and the compute engine is used for the
emergent neural network simulation framework.
