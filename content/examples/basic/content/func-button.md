A **func button** is a [[button]] that is [[value binding|bound]] to a function.

{id="figure_one" style="height=10em"}
![This is the first figure. It should be clear **exactly** what is going on here.](media/fig_one.png)

As you can see in [[#figure_one]], the data turned out just as expected. However, you can never be too careful, because along comes [[#figure_two]], and now look.

{id="figure_two" style="height=5em"}
![This is the second figure. _Ooops_, I guess it is back to the drawing board.](media/fig_two.png)

That just goes to show: science is always interesting.
