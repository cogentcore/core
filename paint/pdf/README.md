# PDF rendering

This package adapts the PDF rendering code from https://github.com/tdewolff/canvas (Copyright (c) 2015 Taco de Wolff, under an MIT License.) to the Cogent Core rendering framework. It is used for rendering PDFs of content documentation, producing publication-ready output from markdown input.  It is also used by the Cogent Canvas SVG drawing app to render PDFs of SVGs.
